# Full Version Roadmap Completeness Audit

Date: 2026-09-21  
Project: Crypto Signal  
Safety invariant: **REAL_CAPITAL=0**

## Executive result

**Stage 10 Full Integrated Acceptance is PASS, but the entire Full Version roadmap
is not yet complete.**

The runtime-accepted Stage 10 code is tagged
`stage10-accepted-20260921` and resolves to commit
`8ca23e612ba36b4ebcb0c3cb41a166d78add5cff`.

The remaining material roadmap gap is the unfinished bounded Stage 8 sequence
(sentiment/attention and cross-market context), followed by Stage 8.5 Alpha Factory
and Stage 8.75 Learning Memory. The governing architecture remains
`docs/INTELLIGENCE_ALPHA_FACTORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`; accepted Stage 8 engines stay
observation-only until a separately accepted integration/meta policy exists.

This audit prevents Stage 10 success from being misrepresented as completion of
roadmap stages that were intentionally outside the accepted Stage 10 runtime
matrix.

## Accepted / materially complete areas

The current repository and runtime evidence support these accepted areas:

- core immutable signal/evidence pipeline,
- point-in-time-safe live evidence and frozen signal ledger,
- core Price Action / Harmonic / Elliott evidence stack,
- historical evaluation and honest evidence classes,
- immutable 100 USDT paper-fund domain,
- deterministic execution cost / fee / spread / slippage contracts,
- paper portfolio and closed-trade performance truth,
- same-start cash / BTC / equal-weight benchmarks,
- Mission Control v4,
- beginner Gift Edition UX,
- signal/trade archive,
- System Health / freshness semantics,
- Stage 10 repository + runtime integrated acceptance,
- production product remains read-only,
- production paper write policy remains `NOT_ACTIVATED`,
- `REAL_CAPITAL=0`.

## Remaining Stage 8 implementation sequence

The governing roadmap explicitly requires the following engines to be introduced
one at a time behind isolated gates:

1. deterministic regime labeling — **ACCEPTED** at `4cdfbd134597a8329fb90d08eed5643161cd4926`,
2. trend/momentum — **ACCEPTED** at `f8b525e355a7fb587e9c0913965326a67630576a`,
3. mean reversion — **ACCEPTED** at `4e6d25df7f6aa2f36bf4ee86dba5c9023dd055d4`,
4. breakout/volatility — **ACCEPTED** at `f44157fa2b8a3788b85608a872eb8fa8fde7d5b3`,
5. bounded derivatives context — **ACCEPTED** at `011f2c4c7be2bd00410c5a0f3f578e20bd84c891`,
6. order-flow/microstructure if data quality supports it — **ACCEPTED** at `f0b27d41980714ffc42fe394ed3a3485acc6d5fe`,
7. on-chain/network — **ACCEPTED** at `589dd427c4f75641c1598e02afc103b238f74cd9`,
8. bounded sentiment/attention — **NEXT FRONTIER / SOURCE-QUALITY GATE**,
9. cross-market context.

Every engine must have:

- deterministic source contract,
- point-in-time safety,
- frozen evidence,
- independent tests,
- contribution/ablation evidence,
- explicit uncertainty.

The audit is updated incrementally as each isolated engine passes its own gates.
Unaccepted later engines remain **NOT YET ACCEPTED**, not silently inferred from
Stage 10 or from neighboring Stage 8 engines.

## Remaining Stage 8.5 — Alpha Factory

The architecture exists, but the accepted implementation still needs an isolated
research environment supporting bounded challenger generation and evaluation.

Required promotion boundary remains:

1. data-contract and leakage audit,
2. deterministic/reproducible rule/training generation,
3. transaction-cost/slippage stress,
4. in-sample sanity,
5. out-of-sample evaluation,
6. walk-forward evaluation,
7. untouched-forward paper evaluation,
8. robustness/ablation checks,
9. explicit supervisor acceptance.

A challenger must not self-promote or modify the stable champion.

## Remaining Stage 8.75 — Learning Memory

The accepted implementation still needs a versioned and reproducible knowledge
layer that records both success and failure by:

- method,
- asset,
- timeframe,
- regime,
- version,
- uncertainty,
- redundancy / overlap,
- before-vs-after policy/model changes.

Learning Memory is evidence, not authority. It may influence future weighting
only through a separately tested policy.

## Canonical next frontier

The next bounded roadmap slice is:

`stage8-bounded-sentiment-attention-v1`

Regime labeling, trend/momentum, mean reversion, breakout/volatility, bounded derivatives context, order-flow/microstructure and on-chain/network are accepted.

Before implementing sentiment/attention intelligence, the repository must pass a source-quality gate. A source must be public or otherwise explicitly governed, reproducible, time-addressable, bounded and either point-in-time safe or explicit about ingestion-time availability.

A named metric such as Fear & Greed, a social score or popularity rank is not accepted merely because it is easy to fetch. Source construction, timestamp semantics and historical availability must be mechanically defensible. If those semantics cannot be supported, record explicit deferral rather than fabricating sentiment evidence and advance to cross-market context.

Any accepted sentiment/attention engine remains observation-only until a separately accepted integration/meta policy exists.

## Safety boundary

This audit does not reopen the accepted Stage 10 code or authorize production
paper writes.

- Stage 10 tag remains immutable evidence of the accepted product/runtime line.
- PAPER/STABLE remains at its accepted stable head unless separately authorized
  through its own gate.
- No real exchange endpoint/credential authority is introduced.
- `REAL_CAPITAL=0`.
