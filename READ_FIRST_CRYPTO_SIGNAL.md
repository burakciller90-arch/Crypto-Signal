# READ FIRST — Crypto Signal

This repository is governed by the user's **CRYPTO SIGNAL PLATFORM — MASTER HANDOFF v1.0 (2026-09-19)**.
If any local note conflicts with that handoff, the master handoff wins.

## Hard boundaries
- This project is separate from Durdurulmaz and Quantum Capital.
- Do not share repos, runtime state, DBs, credentials, ports, launchd labels, supervisors, brokers, chat state, or roadmaps.
- Runtime owner: `crypto-signal-agent`; actual UID is discovered mechanically, never hard-coded.
- `REAL_CAPITAL = 0`. V1 never sends exchange orders.
- V1 core is Price Action/SMC/ICT + Harmonic + Elliott + Confluence.
- V2+ must not create V1 scope creep.

## Scientific constitution
- Point-in-time truth; no future leakage.
- Freeze signal before outcome; never rewrite history or delete losses.
- Missing data is never invented.
- Confluence score != win probability.
- Historical win rate != calibrated probability.
- Backtest != untouched-forward evidence.
- NO_SIGNAL, AMBIGUOUS and NOT_EVALUABLE are valid.
- Numeric truth comes from deterministic/statistical evidence, not LLM prose.

## Operating rule
Read this file, then `CURRENT_STATUS.md`, then the newest `PROJECT_CHRONICLE.md` entry before changing project state.
