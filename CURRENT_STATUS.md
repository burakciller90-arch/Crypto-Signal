# CURRENT STATUS

Updated: 2026-09-20
Project: Crypto Signal
Phase: Confluence + Signal Semantics V1
State: IMMUTABLE_LIVE_LEDGER_ACTIVE
REAL_CAPITAL: 0

## Accepted foundations
- Phase 0 Environment & Constitution
- Phase 1 Data Truth
- Shared deterministic swing primitives
- PA / SMC / ICT V1
- Harmonic V1
- Elliott Wave V1

## Elliott V1 accepted evidence
- partial Wave 1 through Wave 5 structural counts
- standard impulse hard-rule evidence
- generic A-B-C endpoint candidates
- zigzag compatibility without false subdivision certainty
- competing counts preserved
- structural invalidation and Fibonacci guideline projections
- truncation evidence retained
- rule-support fractions explicitly non-probabilistic
- 127 tests PASS
- Ruff PASS
- mypy PASS
## Elliott live evidence
Long 15m Bybit:
- 4,798 closed candles
- 5,110 impulse candidates
- 1,020 completed counts
- 63 hard-price-rule-valid completed counts
- 33 valid counts with truncated fifth evidence
- 1,022 A-B-C candidates
- 316 zigzag-compatible endpoint geometries
- 870 ambiguous end pivots with multiple valid competing counts

Long 15m Binance:
- 4,798 closed candles
- 4,900 impulse candidates
- 978 completed counts
- 60 hard-price-rule-valid completed counts
- 28 valid counts with truncated fifth evidence
- 980 A-B-C candidates
- 304 zigzag-compatible endpoint geometries
- 828 ambiguous end pivots with multiple valid competing counts
Multi-timeframe deterministic smoke PASS on both providers for:
- 15m
- 1h
- 4h
- 1D
- 1W

These are structural candidate counts, not uniquely correct Elliott labels,
probabilities, win rates or execution recommendations.

## Autonomous continuity
Local wake/lease transport is active at the control-plane level:
- exact Crypto chat URL is bound in runtime state
- UID504 continuity bridge runs as a KeepAlive LaunchAgent
- exact-task immutable lease is active
- UID504 submits HMAC-authenticated events into a shared relay queue
- relay secret/target ACL allows only UID504 and UID502
- UID502 Safari exact-URL probe: one matching tab, JavaScript automation PASS
- UID502 relay watchdog runs from launchd and starts the actual relay through Terminal to preserve macOS TCC authority
- live busy-guard evidence repeatedly reports CHATGPT_BUSY while this response is active
- first post-turn real submission receipt remains the final end-to-end acceptance evidence
- generic idle wake remains disabled

Cursor Agent CLI is installed but remains not logged in; workers are optional and do not block supervisor development.

A foreign Durdurulmaz wake was reconciled as NOOP for Crypto Signal.
No Durdurulmaz or Quantum Capital project state was mutated; UID502 is used only as isolated GUI transport.

## Confluence Slice 1 accepted evidence
- methodology-neutral evidence model added
- PA current resolved structure maps to CONTEXT evidence only
- valid Harmonic matches preserve PRZ / invalidation / T1-T2 / residual metrics
- valid-so-far Elliott counts preserve invalidation / projections / competing-count ambiguity
- invalid Harmonic/Elliott artifacts are rejected at the adapter boundary
- neutral PIT invariant: market_available_at <= observed_at <= as_of
- metrics remain descriptive and unnormalized
- 133 tests PASS
- Ruff PASS
- mypy PASS

## Confluence Slice 2 accepted evidence
- latest-market-time selection per methodology
- same-timestamp alternatives preserved
- one directional vote maximum per methodology
- internal bullish/bearish conflict resolves to UNRESOLVED and casts no vote
- pairwise AGREE / CONTRADICT / INTERNAL_AMBIGUITY / INSUFFICIENT matrix
- deterministic score = (support - opposition) / 3 * 100
- score rounded to 2 decimals and explicitly tagged agreement_index_not_probability
- 140 tests PASS
- Ruff PASS
- mypy PASS
- live Bybit/Binance confluence smoke PASS
- live 15m example: PA bullish; Harmonic no valid evidence; Elliott internally conflicting; resulting score 33.33 with partial coverage flag

## Signal Slice 1 accepted evidence
- freeze-ready SignalDecision model
- initial states: NO_SIGNAL / NEUTRAL / WATCH / ACTIVE
- ACTIVE requires 2+ independent supporting methodologies, zero opposing votes and exactly one complete geometry source
- WATCH preserves one complete geometry when available but does not activate without independent support
- multiple complete geometry candidates are not silently ranked
- entry midpoint used only as descriptive R/R reference, not execution assumption
- invalidation trigger is preserved from source evidence
- probability status = NOT_CALIBRATED
- historical analogue status = NOT_EVALUATED
- deterministic SHA256 freeze identity
- 148 tests PASS
- Ruff PASS
- mypy PASS
- live Bybit/Binance signal smoke PASS
- current live 15m state on both providers: WATCH bullish, confluence score 33.33, no geometry, no fabricated probability

## Signal Slice 2 accepted evidence
- immutable SignalDecision remains unchanged
- append-only invalidation transition model
- only fully post-decision closed/observed candles may invalidate
- decision-time partial candle is skipped to prevent pre-decision OHLC contamination
- explicit NO_NEW_EVIDENCE / COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE_GAPS coverage states
- missing candle opens are explicit and never invented
- TOUCH_OR_CROSS and CLOSE_AT_OR_BEYOND semantics preserved
- deterministic transition identity
- 158 tests PASS
- Ruff PASS
- mypy PASS
- live-safe Bybit/Binance smoke PASS
- current live 15m decisions on both providers: WATCH bearish, score 33.33
- lifecycle at decision as-of: NO_NEW_EVIDENCE

## Immutable Live Ledger active evidence
- decision freeze bundle includes SignalDecision, Confluence, selected evidence, raw PA/Harmonic/Elliott and exact consumed closed candles
- signal freeze identity and broader bundle identity are separate
- SQLite WAL store is SQL-immutable: UPDATE/DELETE rejected by triggers
- same signal/source-cutoff equivalent retry is idempotent
- same source cutoff with different bundle is explicit conflict
- lifecycle evaluations append only
- live clock runner is protected by a non-blocking process lock
- LaunchAgent com.cryptosignal.liveevidenceclock is active with RunAtLoad + 120-second interval
- pilot scope: BTCUSDT 15m, Bybit Spot + Binance Spot, 500-candle window
- first production untouched-forward freezes created 2026-09-20 03:29:18-03:29:19 Europe/Istanbul
- production re-kickstart on same cutoff returned ALREADY_FROZEN for both providers
- production DB remained exactly 2 freezes + 2 lifecycle evaluations after idempotence check
- ledger/live-clock acceptance: 170 tests PASS, Ruff PASS, mypy PASS

## Canonical next frontier
Outcome + Historical Evaluation V1:
1. outcome state contract
2. target/stop ordering and same-candle ambiguity
3. timeout / cancelled / invalidated / not-evaluable semantics
4. append-only outcome records bound to immutable signal freezes
5. evidence-class separation: RETROSPECTIVE / WALK_FORWARD / LIVE_UNTOUCHED_FORWARD
6. segmented metrics by methodology/setup/symbol/timeframe/direction/confluence bucket
7. sample-size-aware performance summaries with no probability fabrication

The live evidence clock continues while Outcome development proceeds.
REAL_CAPITAL remains 0.
